# Fxquant

Fxquant is a tool that enables c++ developer to research, develop, optimise, backtest and live trade forex trading strategies.

**This is incomplete work in progress.** I made the decition creating this due to the luck of available open source options in C++.

Fxquant supports Win & Ubuntu.
